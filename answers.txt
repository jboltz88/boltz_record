1. A ruby gem is a packaged piece of code that allows you to
   add functionality to your applications in a very modular way. Gems
   allow you to bypass writing a lot of functionality or tools into
   your program by integrating them into your program.

2. Eager loading cuts down the number of SQL queries by loading
   everything you will need and then holding it in memory.
   Lazy loading just queries the database as needs arise. This
   leads to hitting the database more often with queries to find
   specific entries.

3. CREATE TABLE creates the table that holds the values for the data
   you're wanting to hold in a database. The attributes for a table
   are determined by the CREATE TABLE method initially. INSERT INTO
   enters new data into a table that has already been created. It can
   only enter data for attributes that have already been determined.

4. Extend gives access to another module's methods as class methods.
   Include gives access to another module's methods as instance methods.

5. A save method on a class doesn't make sense. In order to save data for
   a specific object that is an instance of some class, you need to be using
   a method that applies to instances and not the class as a whole.

6. UPDATE character
   SET character_name = 'Jar-Jar Binks', star_rating = 1)
   WHERE id = 1;

7. We'll have to add a function that queries the database for all entries.
   i.e. SELECT * FROM entries;

8. def camelCase(string)
      string = string.tr("_", " ")
      string = string.downcase
      string = string.split(" ")
      string[1..string.length - 1].each { |word| word.capitalize! }
      string = string.join("")
   end

9.  def find_by(attribute, value)
      row = connection.get_first_row <<-SQL
        SELECT #{columns.join ","} FROM #{table}
        WHERE #{attribute} = #{value};
      SQL

      data = Hash[columns.zip(row)]
      new(data)
    end
